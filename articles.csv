"SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

Ukraine needs the millions of dollars in military aid President Trump was holding back at the time of that phone call with Ukraine's president because of the threat from Russia, which took over Crimea in 2014. Julia Davis, a Russian disinformation expert at the Atlantic Council, says that she sees Russia's fingerprints in the unfounded charges President Trump makes about the Biden family in Ukraine. Julia Davis, thanks so much for being with us.

JULIA DAVIS: Thank you so much for having me.

SIMON: What do you see that you consider to be compelling evidence of Russian involvement?

DAVIS: Well, it's undeniable in Russia's own words and actions and how much they align with President Trump's words and actions. And if you look at the objectives pursued by President Trump in his controversial conversation with the president of Ukraine, all of the aims that he articulated would not serve the national interests of the United States at all. But each one of them would serve Russia's interests and ultimately would lead to the lifting of the sanctions if those objectives were accomplished.

SIMON: A Kremlin spokesperson says that Moscow doesn't want transcripts of conversations between President Trump and Vladimir Putin released. The spokesperson says, we would like to hope that wouldn't come - that it wouldn't come to that in our relations. How do you read that?

DAVIS: Russia is understandably concerned because in the conversation with Ukraine's president, you could see him being in a subservient position to President Trump. And I think you would see the opposite in - if the transcripts of conversations with Putin were to be a released. And if you saw...

SIMON: You're suggesting President Trump would seem subservient to President Putin.

DAVIS: Absolutely, and that was clear from his public appearance in Helsinki, for example. And I'm sure that the telephone calls would be even more revealing as to the true nature of their relationship with - between the president of Russia and the president of the United States.

SIMON: I gather - you are a native Ukrainian speaker. You've been honored as a friend of Ukraine. Is President Zelenskiy, who's just been in office a few weeks, being put in a tough position by the events of this week?

DAVIS: No doubt he has been put between a rock and a hard place because by playing along with Trump, he is alienating the Democratic Party. If he were to go the other way, he would alienate the Republicans. And by the way, that already put a strain there because Ukraine is now prominently figuring in the impeachment proceedings. And Ukraine has traditionally relied on bipartisan support from the United States, which is now in peril. So he is definitely in a no-win situation.

SIMON: Are you concerned as someone who is an advocate for Ukraine on the world stage? Are you concerned that Ukraine interests might - that there are Republicans who might feel that Ukraine doesn't - they don't share an interest in the survival of Ukraine?

DAVIS: Yes, I've already heard some Republicans on television making statements that they have no confidence in Ukraine. So yes, it will definitely undermine the support for Ukraine. And it's very concerning.

SIMON: Do you see Russian fingerprints in the information about the Biden family?

DAVIS: Most certainly. Russian State Television, which is tightly controlled by the Kremlin, has been putting forward this narrative for a very long time period. And their main hope was that by exposing their so-called nonexistent dirt on Biden, the entire Obama administration would be discredited, and Russia would be cleared from the proven allegations of election interference, and all the blame would be placed on Ukraine.

SIMON: Julia Davis writes for The Daily Beast, also with the Atlantic Council. Thanks so much for being with us.

DAVIS: Thank you very much for having me."
"President Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 began with Trump congratulating Zelensky on having won his election earlier this year. Very quickly, though, Trump got down to business.

“I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,” Trump said, according to a rough transcript of the conversation released by the White House on Wednesday. “We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.” Trump criticized European countries such as Germany for not doing more.

“The United States has been very very good to Ukraine,” Trump continued. “I wouldn’t say that it’s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.”


Zelensky agreed, telling Trump that he had met with leaders from France and Germany and pushed them to do more.

“The European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and I’m very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine,” he said. “Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation.” Those sanctions, it’s worth noting, were imposed by Congress and only reluctantly implemented by Trump.

Zelensky then says that Ukraine is anticipating soon buying Javelin missiles from the United States for defensive purposes, the sort of transaction that Trump has used as a rationale for being accommodating to countries such as Saudi Arabia.


Trump doesn’t seize on that offer, though. Instead, having just reminded Zelensky of how much the United States does for Ukraine, he goes in a different direction.

He asks for a favor.

Here’s what Trump said next:

“I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”


As is often the case when Trump discusses complex issues, he refers to various things using a hard-to-decrypt shorthand. That shorthand is important here, though, so let’s break it out.

This call occurred one day after former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III testified on Capitol Hill about the contents of his report looking at Russian interference in the 2016 election. That investigation determined that Russia had tried, moving along multiple tracks, to influence the election that brought Trump to the White House. Russia spread misinformation and dissent on social media. Russians linked to the government sought interactions with Trump’s campaign team. And Russians working for the government hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s network and the email account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta, stealing information that was ultimately released publicly by WikiLeaks. It’s all documented in the report Mueller described to legislators on July 24."
"Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the Russian Internet (RuNet) into law to protect the country’s communications infrastructure in case it was disconnected from the world wide web—or so he said. Critics argued it was opening a door to a Chinese-style firewall disconnecting Russia from the outside world.

Now, Alexander Zharov, the head of the federal communications regulator Roskomnadzor has confirmed to reporters that “equipment is being installed on the networks of major telecom operators,” and RuNet will begin testing by early October. Such testing, reporters were told, is known as “combat mode.”


When the legislation was introduced there was some debate as to whether it would work in practice. The government claimed its objective was to deal with ""threats to the stable, safe and integral operation of the Russian Internet on Russian territory,"" by centralizing ""the general communications network."" This would works by deploying an alternative domain name system (DNS) for Russia to steer its web traffic away from international servers. ISPs are mandated to comply.

The Moscow Times reported at the time that ""Russia carried out drills in mid-2014 to test the country's response to the possibility of its internet being disconnected from the web—the secret tests reportedly showed that isolating the Russian internet is possible, but that 'everything' would go back online within 30 minutes.""

As for this “combat testing,” Zharov has assured that everything will be done “carefully,” according to local media reports, explaining that “we will first conduct a technical check—affects traffic, does not affect traffic, do all services work.” The plan is for all of this testing to be completed by the end of October.

Although the regulator has been keen to emphasise that RuNet is only for deployment when the system its perceived to be “in danger,” there is a clear question as to where and how such a decision would be taken. Such threats have been classified as “impacts to the integrity of networks, the stability of networks, natural or man-made impacts, or security threats,” all pretty wide-ranging classifiers.

Russia’s recent moves to shut down cellular data traffic to stymie anti-Putin protesters and government warnings that social media access may be curtailed have not brought much confidence to its tech savvy citizens.

Runet is due to go live in November. According to Freedom On The Net, ""Russian internet freedom has declined for the sixth year in a row, following government efforts to block the popular messaging app Telegram and numerous legislative proposals aimed at restricting online anonymity and increasing censorship.""

And there are no signs of that getting any better any time soon."
"(CNN)Top officials at the National Rifle Association knew Russians were using their ties to the gun rights group to try to bolster their status with lawmakers or the winner of the 2016 presidential election, a new report from Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee shows.

In 2015, Russian national Maria Butina, who last year pleaded guilty to conspiracy as an unregistered foreign agent, tapped her political operative boyfriend Paul Erickson to help her convince a top NRA official to come to Moscow, according to the committee report made public Friday.
""Russia believes that high level contacts with the NRA might be the BEST means of neutral introduction to either the next American President OR to a meaningful re-set in relations with the Congress under a (God forbid) President Clinton,"" Erickson, a GOP political operative wrote to Peter Brownell, the chief executive of a firearm accessories company and, at the time, the incoming president of the NRA. ""This simple good will trip would have enormous diplomatic consequences for a future U.S. / Russia bilateral relationship to the world.""
Butina dangled a potential meeting, apparently with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as meetings with companies in the Russian firearms industry that would be ""really very good"" for Brownell's business, to entice him to attend the 2015 Moscow trip. Brownell joined the trip, although his lawyer told the committee there was never a plan to meet Putin. Brownell's lawyer also told the committee that Brownell planned to explore business opportunities while in Russia.
The findings come amid a report from Democrats on the committee as they concluded their investigation into the NRA's interactions with Russian nationals. The Democrats raised questions about whether the gun rights group violated its nonprofit status, and concluded the NRA openly fostered relationships with Russian nationals, including Butina and former Russian central banker Alexander Torshin, who sought to build relationships in US political circles.
The criticism also comes amid a tumultuous period for the NRA. The group has been plagued by infighting, high-profile staff departures and questions about its spending practices.
The NRA has previously said it has acted appropriately to maintain its nonprofit status. The group did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
""During the 2016 election, Russian nationals effectively used the promise of lucrative personal business opportunities to capture the NRA and gain access to the American political system,"" Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement. ""The totality of evidence uncovered during my investigation, as well as the mounting evidence of rampant self-dealing, indicate the NRA may have violated tax laws.""
The committee also uncovered indications the NRA was footing the bill for some of the group's top officials to travel in pursuit of business interests or under the cover of a nonprofit group in order to meet with sanctioned individuals and entities in Russia.

Wyden added that ""the NRA lied about the 2015 delegation trip to Moscow. This was an official trip undertaken so NRA insiders could get rich -- a clear violation of the principle that tax-exempt resources should not be used for personal benefit.""
Wyden called on the IRS to investigate further, as did Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who said the group's ""status as a tax exempt entity needs to be thoroughly investigated.""
Republicans did not join Democrats in their report but rather issued a brief accompanying report that concluded, ""the Minority report reads more like a political document directed at an organization well known in U.S. politics to be despised by Democrats because of its advocacy for Second Amendment rights. This Majority finds no wrongdoing by the NRA or its officials that would reasonably call into question the NRA's tax-exempt status, based on the documents provided to the Committee.""
On Friday, the NRA's outside counsel slammed the report from Senate Democrats as a ""politically motivated and contrived narrative.""
""This report goes to great lengths to try to involve the NRA in activities of private individuals and create the false impression that the NRA did not act appropriately. Nothing could be further from the truth,"" William A. Brewer III, counsel to the NRA, said in a statement.
2015 trip scrutinized
As for the Russians, Butina is currently serving 18 months in prison for her working as an unregistered foreign agent, part of her efforts to infiltrate political groups and bolster Russian interests. In 2018, the Trump administration slapped a handful of Russian government officials and oligarchs with sanctions in retaliation for Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Torshin was among those sanctioned, though he has since left the central bank.
Much of the report focuses on a December 2015 trip to Moscow arranged by Butina and former NRA president and board member David Keene.
The trip's attendees included top NRA officials, such as Keene, Brownell and Joe Gregory, who runs a high-dollar NRA fundraising program. Ryan Repp, a spokesman for Brownell, said he was a ""last-minute addition"" to the trip.
""He went to support the NRA as the incoming President, and would not have gone if it was not an NRA trip. Pete received absolutely no business for his company as a result of this trip. He has fully cooperated with all inquiries into this matter and will continue to do so,"" Repp said. Messages left with Keene and Gregory seeking comment were not immediately returned.
Torshin and Butina were playing host. The trip was to include a visit to the Red Square, tours of a Russian tank and car museum and a Russian gun factory, meetings with Russian VIPs (including some on the US sanctions list) and the ""best restaurants of Russian cuisine,"" according to an email Butina sent one of the participants, which is detailed in the report.
But when a key NRA official canceled ahead of the trip, other NRA leaders got a glimpse into the motives Russian officials had for cozying up to the NRA.
During the planning, Allan Cors, who was then serving as NRA president, dropped out of the Moscow junket. He blamed health issues at the time, although later the NRA would claim it was because NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre had misgivings about the trip.
Losing Cors set off a frenzy.
""Your canceling will risk--I think completely burn--all the inroads NRA volunteers have worked on so hard for so long. It will hurt Torchin's (sic) pro-American career,"" according to an email David Keene's wife, Donna Keene, sent to Cors. She added: ""we've worked for 7 years to build trust with the Russians. They are status-conscious and have spent untold hours and dollars on us. Allan, please, please come.""
Donna Keene also forwarded Cors an email from Butina. ""Many powerful figures in the Kremlin are counting on Torshin to prove his American connections -- a last minute important member cancellation could affect his political future. It cannot be certain,"" Butina said in the email, according to the committee report.
In recent months, the NRA has claimed the trip was an unofficial event.
The gun rights group reiterated that position on Friday. ""Certain NRA members made the trip of their own accord,"" Andrew Arulanandam, NRA managing director of Public Affairs, said in a statement. ""The record reflects it was not an official NRA trip. NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre was opposed to it and, at his directive, no NRA staff members or employees attended.""
But the documentation included in the report reveals NRA staffers helped arrange trip logistics and the NRA picked up at least some of the bill. And while staff-level members may not have attended, top NRA officials did.
At one point, as Cors is bowing out of the trip, he notes other officials who will be attending and writes to Torshin that they ""will represent the NRA and our five million members better than anyone else.""
In latest sign of turmoil, NRA loses three of its lawyers

A week after Wyden opened an initial inquiry into the relationship between the NRA and Torshin, the NRA sought additional reimbursements from the Moscow trip from Brownell, according to the report. Brownell's attorney, who cooperated with the committee for its report, characterized the reimbursement, as a way of ""getting the trip off the NRA's books,"" according to the report.
Questions over whether activities ran afoul under US sanctions law
The report also raised concerns about members of the NRA delegation using their roles in a nonprofit organization to meet with sanctioned entities in Russia and advance personal business interests.
""This report concludes that some members of the NRA delegation traveled to Russia to cultivate future business opportunities. Some of these NRA members also met with sanctioned individuals,"" the report states. ""These interactions raise significant concerns under U.S. sanctions law.""
Wyden also called on the Treasury Department to ""investigate whether Russian arms manufacturers are evading sanctions to do business in the United States.""
Ultimately, the committee's investigative resources were limited. Democrats make up the minority in the Senate and do not control the committees or have subpoena power. While some members of the 2015 Moscow delegation provided information and documents, including Brownell, others did not. The NRA provided some documents but refused to answer many of the committee's questions or provide financial documents.
Still, the report comes as the NRA's finances are under investigation by attorneys general in Washington, as well as New York. The gun-safety group, Everytown for Gun Safety, has also said it filed a complaint about the NRA's tax-exempt status with the IRS."
"President Trump told two senior Russian officials in a 2017 Oval Office meeting that he was unconcerned about Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election because the United States did the same in other countries, an assertion that prompted alarmed White House officials to limit access to the remarks to an unusually small number of people, according to three former officials with knowledge of the matter.

The comments, which have not been previously reported, were part of a now-infamous meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, in which Trump revealed highly classified information that exposed a source of intelligence on the Islamic State. He also said during the meeting that firing FBI Director James B. Comey the previous day had relieved “great pressure” on him.

A memorandum summarizing the meeting was limited to a few officials with the highest security clearances in an attempt to keep the president’s comments from being disclosed publicly, according to the former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.


The White House’s classification of records about Trump’s communications with foreign officials is now a central part of the impeachment inquiry launched this week by House Democrats. An intelligence community whistleblower has alleged that the White House placed a record of Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukraine’s president, in which he offered U.S. assistance investigating his political opponents, into a code-word classified system reserved for the most sensitive intelligence information.

The White House did not provide a comment Friday.

It is not clear whether a memo documenting the May 10, 2017, meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak was placed into that system, but the three former officials said it was restricted to a very small number of people. The White House had recently begun limiting the records of Trump’s calls after remarks he made to the leaders of Mexico and Australia appeared in news reports. The Lavrov memo was restricted to an even smaller group, the former officials said.

A fourth former official, who did not recall the president’s remarks to the Russian officials, said memos were restricted only to people who needed to know their contents.


“It was more about learning how can we restrict this in a way that still informs the policy process and the principals who need to engage with these heads of state,” the fourth former official said.

But the three former officials with knowledge of the remarks said some memos of the president’s communications were kept from people who might ordinarily have access to them. The Lavrov memo fit that description, they said.

White House officials were particularly distressed by Trump’s election remarks because it appeared the president was forgiving Russia for an attack that had been designed to help elect him, the three former officials said. Trump also seemed to invite Russia to interfere in other countries’ elections, they said.

The previous day, Trump had fired Comey amid the FBI’s investigation into whether the Trump campaign had coordinated with Russia. White House aides worried about the political ramifications if Trump’s comments to the Russian officials became public.

Unraveling the story about Trump, Biden and Ukraine

Trump had publicly ridiculed the Russia investigation as politically motivated and said he doubted Moscow had intervened in the election. By the time he met with Lavrov and Kislyak, Trump had been briefed by the most senior U.S. intelligence officials about the Russian operation, which was directed by Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and included the theft and publication of Democratic emails and the seeding of propaganda in social media, according to the findings of the U.S. intelligence community.


Trump’s firing of Comey touched off an investigation into whether the president had tried to obstruct the FBI’s probe. His comments about Comey’s dismissal being a relief, which were first reported the same month by the New York Times, reinforced suspicions that Trump dismissed Comey because the FBI was investigating him.

According to the fourth former official, Trump lamented to Lavrov that “all this Russia stuff” was detrimental to good relations. Trump also complained, “I could have a great relationship with you guys, but you know, our press,” this former official said, characterizing the president’s remarks.

H.R. McMaster, the president’s then-national security adviser, repeatedly told Trump he could not trust the Russians, according to two former officials.

On some areas, Trump conveyed U.S. policy in a constructive way, such as telling the Russians that their aggression in Ukraine was not good, one of those former officials said.


“What was difficult to understand was how they got a free pass on a lot of things — election security and so forth,” this former official said. “He was just very accommodating to them.”

The former official observed that Trump has “that streak of moral equivalency,” recalling how he once dismissed a question about the assassination of journalists and dissidents in Putin’s Russia by telling Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly: “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?”

Another former official said Trump wasn’t the only one to conflate Russia’s interference in the U.S. elections with U.S. efforts to promote democracy and good governance abroad.

The president and his top aides seemed not to understand the difference between Voice of America, a U.S.-supported news organization that airs in foreign countries, with Russian efforts to persuade American voters by surreptitiously planting ads in social media, this person said.

One former senior official said Trump regularly defended Russia’s actions, even in private, saying no country is pure. “He was always defensive of Russia,” this person said, adding the president had never made such a specific remark about interference in their presence.

“He thought the whole interference thing was ridiculous. He never bought into it.”

"LVIV, Ukraine — Oleg Sentsov, a 43-year-old writer and filmmaker recently released from a Russian prison camp in the arctic, should, by the blood-and-soil logic of the Kremlin, have been an easy recruit to President Vladimir V. Putin’s cause of aggrieved Russian nationalism.

In 2014, as today, much of the world’s attention was focused on Ukraine and — at that time — Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow seized from Ukraine. Ethnically Russian, Mr. Sentsov was born and raised in Crimea and, like most residents there, had always spoken Russian, not Ukrainian. Many Russian speakers welcomed Mr. Putin’s seizure of the peninsula with rapturous applause.

But instead of cheering Mr. Putin as a savior of the “Russian world” — an ever-shifting cultural and geopolitical space that includes millions of ethnic Russians suddenly left stranded in foreign countries by the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union — Mr. Sentsov infuriated the Kremlin by insisting that he and fellow Russian-speakers in Crimea never wanted or needed to be saved.

Pretending otherwise, he said in a recent interview, is nothing more than “political necrophilia,” a ghoulish mission to make Russia great again by embracing the corpse of Soviet power.

For that and other outspoken heresies — all the more potent because they come from an ethnic Russian, not a Ukrainian nationalist — Mr. Sentsov endured five years in Russian jails and prison camps.

He wrote three film scripts while in detention. Russia’s prison camps, he said, have slightly better conditions — more food and less violence — than when Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote “The Gulag Archipelago” in the 1960s. But “the system is exactly the same,” he said. “It has one purpose: to create fear.”

His ordeal, much of it spent in frigid camps north of the Arctic Circle, and a global campaign for his release have made the mild-mannered but defiantly determined filmmaker a powerful symbol of resistance to Mr. Putin’s vision of Russia. In 2018, he was awarded the prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament.

“By blood and language, I am totally Russian. By birth, I am Crimean. But by spirit, I am Ukrainian. That is the most important,” Mr. Sentsov said during a visit to western Ukraine after his release as part of a prisoner exchange agreed to by Mr. Putin and Ukraine’s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky.

He declined to say whether his mother, a Russian-speaking pensioner in her 70s who still lives in Russian-occupied Crimea, shared his views. “As a mother, she loves her son,” he said. “That is what matters.” He has two children, a 16-year-old daughter and a 15-year-old son, who has autism.

Set free and flown along with 34 other freed prisoners to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, on Sept. 7, Mr. Sentsov traveled last week to the almost entirely Ukrainian-speaking city of Lviv to present his latest book, written in Russian, at a literary festival and to join a rally in support of scores of Ukrainians still incarcerated in Russia for political reasons.

While in Lviv, Mr. Sentsov was stopped repeatedly for selfies and autographs on the streets of a city that Russian propaganda often presents as filled with fascists frothing with violent hatred for ethnic Russians and their language. A standing-room-only audience at the Lviv Philharmonia concert hall greeted him with an ovation.

The reception, Mr. Sentsov said, strengthened his conviction that the conflict between Moscow and Kiev — a grinding war for control of territory in Russian-speaking regions of eastern Ukraine — is not rooted in any deep divisions of ethnicity and language, but in differing values.

“It is a conflict over values,” Mr. Sentsov said, “between those who want to live like Europeans and those who want to live like we did in the Soviet Union.”

Foremost among the latter, he added, is Mr. Putin, a “totally Soviet person” who, beneath a carefully polished image inside Russia as a tough but enlightened modernizer, “only wants to take Russia back to the past.”

This fact, Mr. Sentsov said, has made it highly unlikely that the recent prisoner swap that secured his release — hailed by President Zelensky, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and many others as an important step toward ending the war in the east — will lead to peace any time soon.

“All wars eventually end in peace,” he said. “But peace between Russia and Ukraine will not happen so long as Putin is in power.”

Born in Crimea into a modest, ethnic Russian family — his father, a native of the Ural Mountains region, worked as a driver before his death — Mr. Sentsov never paid much attention when he was growing up to friends who expressed hostility to Ukrainian rule of Crimea.

He said he did not care about politics and had always been far more interested, particularly after he took up writing and filmmaking, in exploring the inner lives of individuals and how “life is always more complicated and more difficult than it seems.”

His debut feature length film, “Gamer,” released in 2011 to critical acclaim, was shot in Crimea but skirts politics and focuses instead on a Russian-speaking teenager obsessed with video games at the expense of everything else, including his mother and his girlfriend. He eventually breaks his addiction.

Mr. Sentsov was preparing to shoot a second film, “Rhinoceros,” about a thick-skinned gangster who is not quite what he seems, when he got sucked into the protest movement against Ukraine’s former pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. He traveled to Kiev in December 2013 to join protesters in a central square known as Maidan and stayed there until after Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia in late February 2014.

That experience, he said, made him realize just how Ukrainian, rather than Russian, he was in his values. “I never denied being Russian,” he said. “I can’t change the blood of my family. But I understood in Maidan that I’m a Ukrainian and will fight for Ukraine and die for it.”

When Russia in March 2014 sent troops in uniforms stripped of insignia to seize the government building in the Crimean capital, Simferopol, his hometown, Mr. Sentsov left Kiev and went home to try to rally resistance to the takeover. Many residents, including ethnic Russians, he said, opposed Moscow’s land grab but mostly stayed silent out of fear of reprisals by thuggish pro-Russian vigilantes and security officials who flooded into the peninsula from Russia.

“I was shocked at first and wondered, ‘Why don’t we fight?’ We gave up without firing a shot,” he recalled. But after several like-minded friends vanished without a trace, he realized how dangerous, even suicidal, it was to speak up for Ukraine.

Realizing that armed resistance was hopeless in 2014 because Ukraine “had no real army,” he helped evacuate besieged Ukrainian troops, arranging buses to carry more than 1,000 of them to safety on the Ukrainian mainland. But he stayed put himself, determined to show that not everyone in Crimea supported the Russian annexation.

“Under Putin you have three choices: shut up, praise him or die,” he said. He recalled how he expected the latter when, in May 2014, he was seized outside his home in Simferopol and thrown into an unmarked van with his head thrust into a bag by armed men who refused to identify themselves.

They turned out to be Russian security officials, he said, who did not want to kill him, only to terrify him and use him in a propaganda exercise aimed at showing that opponents of Russia’s takeover were terrorists.

Tortured and ordered to confess to belonging to a terror group, he was later taken to Russia, first to Moscow for further, mostly nonviolent interrogation, and then to Rostov-on-Don to stand trial. He said his interrogators offered him a deal: Confess to belonging to a terror organization controlled by officials in Kiev and get a seven-year sentence, or refuse and spend 20 years in jail. He declined the offer."
"TARTUS, Syria (AP) — A Russian submarine has moored at Russia's base in Syria after a patrol mission while another one is getting ready to sail off after replenishing supplies — the rotation that underlines Moscow's growing military foothold in the Mediterranean Sea.

The naval base in Tartus is the only such facility Russia has outside the former Soviet Union. In 2017, Moscow struck a deal with Syrian President Bashar Assad to extend its lease on Tartus for 49 years. The agreement allows Russia to keep up to 11 warships there, including nuclear-powered ones.

Russia has waged a military campaign in Syria since September 2015, allowing Assad's government to reclaim control over most of the country following a devastating civil war.

An air base in the nearby province of Latakia has been the main hub for the Russian military campaign, while the commercial ports in Latakia and Tartus have served as top supply hubs, handling ships with fuel and military equipment in a massive supply effort dubbed the ""Syrian Express.""

"Russia and China appear to be increasing their economic, political and military ties amid poor relations with the West. But the relationship is far more nuanced than it first appears with strengths and weaknesses on both sides, experts note.

While U.S. trade relations with China have soured, as each slap billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs on each other’s goods, trade relations between China and Russia are blossoming. Chinese President Xi Jinping even called Russian President Vladimir Putin his “best friend” in an uncharacteristic display of warm relations during a state visit to Russia this summer.

Xi also promised Putin that China was “ready to go hand in hand with you” and the leaders signed statements committing to “the development of strategic cooperation and comprehensive partnership” between their nations and “strengthening strategic stability (which) includes international issues of mutual interest, as well as issues of global strategic stability.”

Economic ties
Strengthening economic ties is a large part of warm Sino-Russia relations. Last week, Russian and Chinese news agencies reported that the two countries want to double their trade over the next five years, to $200 billion by 2024 — up from $107 billion worth of trade in 2018 — by implementing joint projects in fields of energy, industry and agriculture.

Despite making vows to increase bilateral trade, the economic relationship between Russia and China is not a marriage of equals. The International Monetary Fund expects Russia’s economy to grow 1.2% in 2019; China, meanwhile, is expected to 6.3%.

It’s no surprise then that Russia sees China as a massive growth market at a time when its trade with western nations is sorely restricted. Russia is still subject to economic sanctions for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, as well as interference in the 2016 U.S. election and the nerve agent poisoning of a former double agent in the U.K.

With that in mind, it makes sense that Russia is seeking an economic — and geopolitical — partner and ally to the East.

Their pledge to increase trade comes amid “a bifurcation in the U.S. and China’s spheres of influence,” Cailin Birch, global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC Thursday.

“Obviously, the U.S. and China have no love lost between them and it would make much more sense for Russia to seek to build ties with this massive emerging market which will be a source of growth, in the way that the U.S. won’t be going forward, and with whom they don’t have the same political conflicts, and that presents a lot more opportunities to the Russian market for Russian energy products and developing their economic ties,” she noted.

For China, a partner like Russia that would “set the U.S. slightly ill at ease would be hugely beneficial,” she added.

Russia also has something that China needs in abundance – energy. Russia is among the world’s top three producers of oil and natural gas whereas China is the second largest crude oil importer in the world.

“China is the main source of new energy consumption for fossil fuels particularly, and having a strong partner on its doorstep that’s ramping up its production of crude oil, the fabrication of LNG (liquefied natural gas) and the shipping of that all around the world, would also be beneficial to China,” Birch said.

Russia-China war games
Security and defense is another area where Russia and China have ostensibly sought to build ties and experts agree that Russia has more practical military experience than China. Just last week, China’s ‘People’s Liberation Army’ was one of seven foreign forces (including India and Pakistan) invited to join Russia’s “Tsentr 2019” massive military drills that took place across a swathe of Russia.

It was the second year China has participated, and its continued involvement is seen as significant by experts like Richard Weitz, senior fellow and director of the Center for Political-Military Analysis at Hudson Institute.

“Chinese and Russian national security communities share common objectives that can be promoted through further cooperation, such as border security, military technology development, and counterterrorism,” he told CNBC on Monday.

“They also perceive threats from U.S. and allied positions and policies that they can cooperate to thwart, such as U.S. missile defenses and Western military intervention in regional hotspots. They conversely see opportunities to expand their influence at the expense of the United States, including by undermining U.S. bilateral and multilateral alliances.”

Best of enemies?
The old adage that “my enemy’s enemy is my friend” could be applied currently when it comes to China and Russia’s relationship with the U.S. right now. Sino-U.S. relations are currently more acrimonious than those between Russia and the U.S, given the lack of resolution to the trade dispute,.

For China, President Trump’s decision to up-end the status quo when it came to Sino-U.S. trade — because of what he has seen as unfair trade practices — and to impose billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs on Chinese imports as a result, has dented its economic growth and potential.

Against this backdrop, boosting Sino-Russia bilateral trade could open a door to growth for both Moscow and Beijing as lawmakers and officials confront trade barriers like sanctions and imports tariffs elsewhere.

“There’s a growing consensus that a partnership between Russia and China is quite a powerful force, led by China rather than Russia, but that between the two of them they could represent quite a powerful bloc and I think the U.S. is growing increasingly concerned by that,” the EIU’s Birch noted.

She added that “Russia would be the junior partner based on size of market and its prospect for growth so obviously in that sense, Russia would be pulled into China’s sway slightly.”

China-Russia: A threat or not?
Experts say the scales have tipped in favor of China being the dominant partner in Sino-Russian relationship and that has injected rivalry into the dynamic which is restricting cooperation on an economic and security level.

“It looks like they’re cooperating, it looks like it’s all nice and rosy in Russia-China relations in military terms - but it’s not,” Mathieu Boulegue, research fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, said.

Speaking at a briefing ahead of the military drills involving China, Boulegue said Russia’s message to China when it involved it in its war games last week was “not about cooperation.” “The message that Russia is sending to China is actually quite the opposite if you look at the deep meaning behind it.”

“It’s about matching Chinese interests in the region because Central Asia right now is a new battleground for influence, not just on the economic side but it’s very much about the growing Chinese influence in the military and security sphere.”

Raffaello Pantucci, director of International Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), also said the relationship between Russia and China was mainly a “utilitarian” one and their alliance shouldn’t be overplayed by analysts.

“What does China-Russia think, how will Russia-China react? – they do have different interests and the danger is that we over-exaggerate this strategic alliance. It’s one that has limitations and questions,” he told CNBC Monday

Nonetheless, the U.S. will likely be watching the Sino-Russia alliance, particularly in terms of defense, carefully especially given the recent breakdown of its own long-standing nuclear arms treaty with Russia. The Hudson Institute’s Richard Weitz noted that military ties between China and Russia have increased dramatically in recent years “and look set to deepen in key dimensions in coming years, including regional security cooperation, arms sales, military exercises, and defense dialogues.”

“Sino-Russian security cooperation presents challenges to U.S. interests, including to the regional security balance, U.S.-led sanctions, and U.S. military freedom of action and access. These challenges would grow if China and Russia were to form a full-fledged defense alliance.”"

"Rudy Giuliani, personal lawyer to Donald Trump and a key figure in the Ukraine scandal, will no longer make a paid appearance at a Russia sponsored conference in Armenia, according to The Washington Post.

Giuliani has faced increasing scrutiny in recent weeks over his role in promoting a conspiracy theory at the heart of a whistleblower complaint that has roiled Washington and left Trump the subject of an impeachment inquiry. That conspiracy theory maintains — without any evidence — that former Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in order to protect his son.

Giuliani has shared this theory over the past several months, and claims to have worked to encourage Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden at the behest of Trump administration officials. And Trump himself requested Ukraine work with Giuliani on the investigation on a July phone call that is central to the whistleblower complaint that led to the impeachment inquiry.

Given the Trump administration has only recently emerged from an investigation into possible conspiracy with Russia, and given Giuliani is a central figure in a blossoming scandal, critics expressed concern about the lawyer attending the Eurasian Economic Union event in Armenia, which, in addition to being sponsored by Russia, will feature appearances by US adversaries such as Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.

Further adding to concerns, Giuliani would have been the only American present at the anti-West, pro-Kremlin conference (the Eurasian Economic Union itself is a trade alliance created by Putin to counter the European Union, a partnership of US allies) and was scheduled to speak in a panel moderated by Sergey Glazyev, a loyal Putin ally who is under US sanctions as part of retribution for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some were also concerned about the fact Giuliani’s pay for his appearance seemed to be coming from the Russia government.

When initially asked about the appropriateness of his appearance at the pro-Kremlin event, Giuliani had been unapologetic about his appearance and sarcastically said, “I will try to not knowingly talk to a Russian until this is all over,” according to the Washington Post.


But following public backlash, Giuliani announced Friday evening that he would no longer participate in the conference. He told the Post that he hadn’t been aware Putin would be in attendance and said he was now cancelling because, “Discretion is the better part of valor.”

While Giuliani will no longer attend the conference this year, he’s already participated in the past — although he was largely able to dodge scrutiny until now. Last year, the president’s personal lawyer also spoke in a panel moderated by Glazyev. Giuliani told the Post he had not realized Glazyev would be involved before attending last year, and that when he found out, he made it clear he would just give a speech and leave. He said he doesn’t remember if the two shared any conversations during the conference.

Rudy Giuliani says he’s a private citizen, but he acts like a foreign policy official
As high-profile as Rudy Giuliani may be, he still is a private citizen, serving as Trump’s personal lawyer. He’s been able to benefit from that status by not having to screen his media appearances or paid work. And he is able to receive the full benefits of attorney-client privilege. He is technically allowed to speak at whatever organization he wants to.

The only problem is that he has been given jobs that aren’t typically given to those outside of government. Recent reports have shed light on the fact that he’s been playing the role of an unofficial US envoy to Ukraine by reaching out to Ukraine on behalf of the president. As Vox’s Matt Yglesias wrote:

According to reporting by Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne, and Ellen Nakashima for the Washington Post, it was Giuliani who ran a “shadow Ukraine agenda.” The full scope of the agenda is still a matter of investigation, but it involves sidelining then-National Security Adviser John Bolton and other key officials to pressure the Ukrainian government into fabricating corruption charges against Joe Biden and his family.

Running sensitive diplomatic missions may sound like an odd job for an attorney not formally employed by the United States government. Adding that the attorney in question used to be mayor of New York City doesn’t really explain it.

Private citizens cannot speak on behalf of the US government — doing so is illegal. To prove that his unofficial Ukraine diplomacy was government sanctioned, Giuliani recently read personal texts he exchanged with a State Department official, Kurt Volker, to prove that he was being directed by a government authority live on Fox News. One day after Giuliani shared the texts, Volker resigned.

While Giuliani may be protected as a private citizen, officials like Volker are not. And his attempts to clarify his role seem to have only furthered concerns about the Trump administration and Ukraine. Giuliani may have dropped out of the upcoming event in Armenia, but his continued activity, should it remain of a kind with his recent actions, could very well cause further problems for the Trump administration."
"KIEV, Ukraine — For decades, as Ukraine has drawn a parade of visiting American diplomats and officeholders and investors and political fixers, Russia has rarely been out of anyone’s line of sight.

It’s all about location — and Ukraine’s now-hostile embrace with its big next door neighbor.

Ukraine has become a magnet for all sorts of visitors with expansive — and Moscow-looking — visions. Some see Ukraine as a key to its big neighbor. To others, Ukraine is a crack in Russia’s armor.

While Ukraine has a starring role in the impeachment inquiry in the House, Russia is never far away from anything that happens in Kiev’s territory.

“Ukraine is not another Russia,” objected Yevhen Mahda, director of the Institute of World Policy in Kiev, while discussing on Saturday the dynamics of the turmoil stemming from the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.


During that call, Trump urged Zelensky to work with Attorney General William P. Barr on a possible investigation into Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian gas company that had recruited him as a member of its board.

Biden’s role came to Trump’s attention as the president’s associates — among them Rudolph W. Giuliani — sought to undermine accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

But even before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Americans’ dealings with Ukraine have all taken place in the context of its proximity to Russia.

[Kurt Volker, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, resigns]

Then-President George H.W. Bush told Ukrainians in August 1991 to stick with Moscow and try to preserve the collapsing Soviet Union. Hillary Clinton told Ukrainians in 2013 to spurn Moscow and sign an agreement with the European Union. Ukraine ignored them both.


In 2004, the United States and other countries sponsored exit polls that led to the overturning of a blatantly rigged election. That began an “Orange Revolution” that led some to hope that such an exercise in transparency could be duplicated in Russia.

Instead it turned Russian President Vladimir Putin resolutely against “color” revolutions anywhere. And it didn’t solve Ukraine’s official corruption or general disregard for the rule of law.

More recently, Paul Manafort began working with the Kremlin-backed president in Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych. But in 2014, Yanukovych had to flee the country, and Manafort, who would later become Trump’s campaign chairman, wound up in an American prison.

The man who had served as Yanukovych’s prime minister, Mykola Azarov, currently lives in exile in Moscow to escape Ukrainian criminal charges.


Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) went to Kiev and cheered on the revolutionary crowds who resisted Yanukovych, as a way to send a message to Moscow. A relatively more honest government took office, but Ukraine lost Crimea to Russia in 2014 and has been mired in a separatist war in eastern Ukraine.

And Ukraine’s endemic corruption remains a fact of life.

[Trump says he raised Hunter Biden allegations with China go-between]

On Friday, an International Monetary Fund delegation ended talks with Zelensky’s government after failing to reach a new lending agreement.

“Growth is held back by a weak business environment — with shortcomings in the legal framework, pervasive corruption, and large parts of the economy dominated by inefficient state-owned enterprises or by oligarchs — deterring competition and investment,” an IMF statement read.


When one of those oligarchs, Ihor Kolomoisky, was asked in an interview who would prevail if Zelensky was forced to choose between him and IMF loans, he replied simply: “I will.”

Kolomoisky, who had a business relationship with Zelensky, swears he has kept his distance since this year’s presidential election. Critics don’t believe it.

“Kolomoisky’s influence is direct and transparent,” said Konstantin Batozky, a political analyst. The oligarch said that Ukraine can manage without IMF money, Batozky said.

Running like a river through every Ukrainian political scandal and conflict is the sale and shipment of natural gas. The transit of Russian gas westward to Europe dwarfs Ukraine’s own consumption, by a factor of three in 2018.

The people who profit from it, Kolomoisky said, are not those with expertise in the gas business, but those with political links to the Ukrainian cabinet.


“The business consists of putting documents from one pile onto another,” he said. “It’s like making money out of thin air.”

And the upstream source of most of that money is Russia — which has been noticeably silent on Washington’s latest political storm , even as some Ukrainians worry that in highlighting their failures of governance it plays into Putin’s hands.

It was a gas company, Burisma, that brought Biden on board in 2014, in an apparent effort to clean up its image following the ouster of the graft-ridden Yanukovych administration. (Burisma deals with the extraction of Ukraine’s own natural gas.) A criminal investigation was opened but then allowed to go dormant.

On Friday, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine announced that the investigation covered the years 2010-2012 — during the Yanukovych years and before Biden joined the board. It said there was no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing by the American.


If the country is unable to recast this moment as a fight against corruption, said Oleksandr Solontay, former head of the Power of the People Party, “then in the long-term perspective Ukraine will have an image of total corruption.”

If Ukraine is not Russia, as Mahda accurately pointed out, it bears some cultural resemblance to its big neighbor. Ukrainians’ own “historical inferiority complex,” as he put it, helps to feed Western perceptions of their country always being in Russia’s shadow.

Leaders from around the world have headed to New York this week to attend the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly - but Vladimir Putin and Nicolas Maduro are not among them.

Having skipped the annual diplomatic gathering, the presidents of Russia and Venezuela instead held their own talks in Moscow on Wednesday.

Putin reiterated his support for Maduro's government, but also highlighted the importance of dialogue between the government and the ""opposition forces"".

""No doubt we support the dialogue that you, Mr President, and your government are having with the opposition forces,"" Putin said.

""We believe that any refusal to have dialogue is irrational, harms the country, and only threatens the population's well-being.""

The two leaders were scheduled to hold a one-on-one meeting before attending a working lunch with other officials to discuss bilateral cooperation among other issues.

Before leaving Venezuela, Maduro has said his agenda included holding meetings with ""important business groups"".

No major deals are expected, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the ""implementation of joint projects"" will be on the agenda.

Venezuela has been mired in a deep political crisis since January, when opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president, arguing Maduro's re-election in May 2018 was illegitimate.

Guaido has since been backed by dozens of Western countries and their regional allies.

Maduro has accused the opposition of stirring up violence and of attempting a coup with the help of the United States.

Special relationship 
Russia has been a key ally of Maduro's government during the crisis.

It has agreed to restructure Venezuelan sovereign debt of $3bn and has strengthened its military ties, deploying two Russian nuclear-capable strategic bombers to the country last year.

Over the summer, Moscow said it wanted to continue ""facilitat[ing] the development of Venezuela's military potential"", while the two countries signed an agreement allowing Russia to send military ships to Venezuela.

Russia has also provided support for Venezuela's energy sector - according to a report by the Financial Times, Russia's state-owned company Rosneft was Venezuela's sole supplier of petrol in June. 

Meanwhile, Russia has rejected US criticism over its ties with Venezuela and hit out at a number of Washington's anti-Maduro moves, including the opening of a US representative office for Venezuela in Colombia's capital, Bogota.

Earlier in September, Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry, called on all states ""with influence"" to ""refrain from unilateral steps and to facilitate inter-Venezuelan talks ... and inclusive dialogue in strict agreement with the constitution"".

She also said the US actions were not helping in the efforts to break the political deadlock.

""How can we talk about restoring constitutional order if everyone who is considered legitimate by Washington is being sponsored by Washington,"" Zakharova said."

How Trump’s Response to the Ukraine Scandal Helped Russia

When President Donald Trump released a quasi-transcript of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, he was trying to short-circuit a burgeoning scandal that was fueling a cry for his impeachment. Because there was no making-an-offer-you-can’t-refuse quid pro quo in the memo reconstructing the conversation, Trump believed he could spin this document into a defense. The truth was that this account contained an extremely quid-pro-quo-ish exchange. When Zelensky said Ukraine wanted more US anti-tank weapons, Trump immediately replied with a request for a “favor”: that is, Ukrainian-made dirt he could use against Joe Biden and the Robert Mueller investigation. Even though GOPers and conservative pundits did cite the document in echoing Trump’s claims of innocence, its release did not help the president and his crew. But there was one head of state it did indeed help: Vladimir Putin. 

The memo included remarks from Zelensky that made the new and inexperienced Ukrainian leader—he was previously a television comedian—look pretty damn bad. In the conversation, he slavishly kowtows to Trump’s improper requests. He sucks up to the American president by noting he stayed in one of his properties on a trip to New York City. More significantly, he diminishes the assistance Ukraine has received in its fight against Russia from President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. “They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine,” Zelensky is quoted in the White House account. And Zelensky reportedly agreed to the release of the reconstructed transcript because he had the impression that Trump would only be putting out Trump’s side of the chat—not Zelensky’s. So it appears the Ukrainian leader got played."
"In fact, the majority of combat pilots have flown in Syria, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu stated during a military conference.

“The figures speak for themselves here,” said Russian military newspaper Red Star.  “98 percent of the transport aviation crews and 90 percent of operational-tactical and army aviation crews, and also 60 percent of the long-range aviation pilots have already participated in the previously mentioned operations. Furthermore, nearly one-third of the air defense specialists - 32 percent of the servicemen - have confirmed their mastery and professionalism during the course of the fulfillment of missions in Syria.”

Russia’s intervention in the Syrian Civil War proved pivotal in saving Bashar al-Assad’s regime from defeat by Islamic rebels. While Hezbollah and Iran fought the ground war with troops and advisers that buttressed the sagging Syrian Arab Army, Russia flew constant and devastating air strikes against the rebels (and also killed numerous Syrian civilians). Russia had a chance to test numerous planes, including the Su-35 fighter, the Tu-160 strategic bomber, the Su-57 stealth fighter and various missiles and smart bombs.

Do You Know What Happened Today In History?
Such testing was needed. As The National Interest has previously reported, the Russian military has admitted problems with its equipment, such as smart bombs that missed their targets in Syria because they had never experienced desert conditions while being tested in Russia. The U.S. military has also had its share of weapons that proved better in the laboratory than the battlefield. Today’s F-22 and F-35 fighters, and the deadly smart bombs and air-to-air missiles they carry, owe much to painful lessons learned during the Vietnam War, when American equipment and air combat tactics were found to be unsuitable.

The Vietnam War left the U.S. military devastated for a decade, but it did give the Pentagon a chance to grapple with the challenges of modern aerial warfare, such as anti-aircraft missiles, smart bombs and electronic warfare. The cost was more than 3,700 American aircraft destroyed, plus another 5,000 helicopters.

Russia’s Syria intervention has been far cheaper. Perhaps two dozen or so Russian jets and helicopters have been reported destroyed by enemy fire or accidents, including the accidental downing of an Il-20 surveillance aircraft by Syrian gunners (note that the Syrian Air Force has taken far higher losses).

In return, Moscow has been able to rotate large numbers of aircrew through Syria to gain experience, which they can then pass on to crews back in Russia. Russian Tu-160 and Tu-95 bombers fired cruise missiles at rebel targets in Syria. Syrian ground troops, along with their Iranian and Hezbollah allies, received plentiful air support from Su-24, Su-25 and Su-30 strike aircraft, as well as Mi-24 and Mi-28 helicopters. Some of Russia’s most sophisticated equipment, notably the Su-57 and Su-35 fighters, made at least cameo appearances in Syrian skies.

 
To make this happen, the Russian military had to be capable of mastering a variety of tasks. Mechanics, maintenance equipment and supplies had to be shipped or airlifted from Russia to Syria. Ground controllers and staffs had to plan and coordinate missions in a chaotic multinational environment, while forward controllers had to accurately call in airstrikes.

By the standards of America, which has been practicing overseas air warfare since World War I, this is old hat. But for Russia, this is a new experience, and one that will make Russian airpower both more competent and more confident.

"(Reuters) - Russian internet giant Yandex is launching a video streaming service aimed at rivaling Google’s YouTube that will allow users to publish videos on its personal recommendation platform Yandex Zen, the company said on Friday.

Tech giants such as Facebook and YouTube have been adding features to their video streaming services as the demand for online video traffic grows.

In its latest move, Yandex is following in the footsteps of China’s Toutiao, a core product of Beijing-based company ByteDance. Toutiao has a video channel where bloggers can upload content and an algorithm recommends it to users.

Yandex Zen, which selects content based on user preferences, will allow bloggers to publish up to 15-minute-long videos.

During testing of the new service, the popularity of video products has already outstripped other content. Yandex Zen recorded a total of 20 million video views per day, while the daily audience was 11 million users.

More than half of all Russians watch video content through Yandex’s search engine, but it’s still in third place after the largest video streaming website YouTube and the country’s biggest social network VKontakte, according to a recent survey by Deloitte.

In August, the monthly audience for Yandex Zen was nearly 50 million people."
